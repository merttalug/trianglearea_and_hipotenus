# trianglearea_and_hipotenus
1. The first program takes the dimensions of the right sides of a right triangle as input from the user and calculates the length of the hypotenuse. 

    a2 + b2 = c2



2. The second program requests all three sides of the triangle as input from the user and calculates the perimeter and area of the triangle.

    Perimeter = 2𝑢

    𝑢 = (a+b+c) / 2

    Area * Area = 𝑢 * (𝑢 − 𝑎)* (𝑢 − 𝑏) * (𝑢 − 𝑐)
